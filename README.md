In this exercise, the goal is to optimize the medication delivery process and inventory management of a healthcare service provider by applying association rule techniques. The objective is to identify patterns in the formulation of medications, meaning detecting which medications tend to be prescribed together more frequently. This will enable the entity to improve inventory planning and streamline the delivery of medications to patients.

To achieve this, a data mining algorithm such as Apriori will be used to identify the most frequent combinations of medications in prescriptions and generate association rules. These rules will not only show which medications are prescribed together but will also indicate the confidence in each rule, meaning the probability that if one medication is prescribed, another one is also likely to be prescribed.
